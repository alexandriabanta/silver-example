# H1: silver-example
## H2: silver-example subheader

This is an example of using git and GitHub with 
Android Studio. What I'm writing here is called
"markdown," a simplified version of HTML without
all the headers, styling tags, etc.

This starts a new paragraph.
Next line is part of the paragraph.

New edit so I have an excuse for a commit change update
